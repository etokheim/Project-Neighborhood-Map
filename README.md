# Project Neighborhood Map
*(This assignment is part of the Frontend developer degree at Udacity)*

For this assignment I wrote an app which displays some of my favorite locations in Norway on a map. The application has contact with several public information systems like Wikipedia and Foursquare and takes advantage of their enormous databases to give the user an interesting view of my favorite locations.

If you want to check out the app, just visit the link below or clone/download the project files. (How-to-download under the download section)

**NOTE:** *If you're visiting the app from the online link, which is served via HTTPS, the weather reports will be blocked by your web browser as it's being served over and unencrypted connection to openweathermaps.com (they have payed only access to HTTPS). This is a security measure to protect users personal information. But as this web page doesn't have access to any of your personal information, it is safe to ignore the warning and allow scripts from unauthenticated sources. (in Chrome, there is a button to the right in the address bar).*
